Clave BL (Becero Municipality required the AUESR permit for the BL, but since AUESR no longer exists, this is causing delays. After meetings with the mayor and secretary on April 9th and 10th, positive communication was restored. The mayor is now supportive of issuing the BL quickly, while the secretary insists on AUESR inscription. However, we hope that the mayor's support should help expedite the process. Once the expropriation deed is registered on April 29th and payments are made, the BL can be issued without waiting for final inscription in the Land Registry. If all goes as planned, the BL could be issued by mid-May.  

Gridco (Phase 1): Gridco (Phase 1): One of the promoters, BRUC (22.2%), is facing issues with the issuance of their private plants’ DUP. BRUC is demanding a financial agreement until January 2026. The promoters have requested detailed information about BRUC’s development issues to analyze the situation, but so far, we’ve only been informed that their DUP is delayed, which is affecting their AAE.
A meeting with Gridco on April 11th resulted in an agreement to enforce economic provisions for EPC and transformer payment milestones. If Bruc fails to pay by April16th, Gridco can issue a formal non-fulfillment notice, giving Bruc 20 business days to resolve the issue. If unresolved, a 100% penalty on the debt will be imposed. Future missed payments will incur additional penalties. We can either keep Bruc in the Gridco with the accumulating debt or eject them from the agreement.
